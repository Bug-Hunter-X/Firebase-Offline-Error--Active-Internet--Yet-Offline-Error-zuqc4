# Firebase Offline Error Despite Internet Connection

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Firebase Realtime Database reports an offline error even when the device has a working internet connection.  The issue is likely due to a network configuration problem (the device can connect to the internet generally but not to the specific Firebase servers) or a self-imposed network restriction within the application itself. 

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the `bug.js` script. (This might require setting up proper Firebase credentials and configuring the project.)
4. Observe the error message and network conditions.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers potential fixes: it demonstrates strategies for proper error handling and network monitoring, helping you determine whether your application or the network is the source of the problem.  In addition, it includes checks to verify network connectivity to the Firebase servers specifically, rather than just general internet connectivity.
