The Firebase Realtime Database client sometimes throws a `FirebaseError: The client is offline.` error even when the device has an active internet connection. This is often caused by a network configuration issue where the device can reach the internet but not the Firebase servers.  This is a rare and often frustrating error due to the lack of specific error messages related to network connectivity. Another less frequent cause is a self-imposed restriction in the app, potentially from a feature flag or network monitoring process, inadvertently blocking access.
